              These terms and conditions applies to the BTI Wallet app (hereby

              Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are
              automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly
              advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior
              to using the Application. Unauthorized copying, modification of
              the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks is
              strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of
              the Application, translate the Application into other languages,
              or create derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks,
              copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property
              rights related to the Application remain the property of the
              Service Provider.

              The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application
              is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve
              the right to modify the Application or charge for their services
              at any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you
              that any charges for the Application or its services will be
              clearly communicated to you.

              The Application stores and processes personal data that you have
              provided to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service.
              It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone
              and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly
              advise against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves
              removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
              official operating system of your device. Such actions could
              expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs,
              compromise your phone&rsquo;s security features, and may result in
              the Application not functioning correctly or at all.

              Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services
              that have their own Terms and Conditions. Below are the links to
              the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used
              by the Application:

            <p className="m-0">
              Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume
              responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of the
              Application require an active internet connection, which can be
              Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service
              Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not
              function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you
              have exhausted your data allowance.
            </p>
            <p className="m-0"></p>
            <p className="m-0">
              If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please
              be aware that your mobile network provider&apos;s agreement terms
              still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile
              provider for data usage during the connection to the application,
              or other third-party charges. By using the application, you accept
              responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
              charges if you use the application outside of your home territory
              (i.e., region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you
              are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the
              application, they assume that you have obtained permission from
              the bill payer.

            <p className="m-0"></p>
            <p className="m-0">
              Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume
              responsibility for your usage of the application. For instance, it
              is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged.
              If your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access
              the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.

              In terms of the Service Provider&apos;s responsibility for your
              use of the application, it is important to note that while they
              strive to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times,
              they do rely on third parties to provide information to them so
              that they can make it available to you. The Service Provider
              accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you
              experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality
              of the application.
